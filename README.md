## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Melih Kara!

I have Bsc. in Physics Engineering (Istanbul Technical University), and <br>
       MSc. in Astrophysics (University of Bonn / Germany) <br>

I have worked with `Python` programming language for my studies and for both of my thesis projects. <br>
I am currently,
- working on possible machine learning applications on the simulated eROSITA data
- working as a teaching assistant for the "*Data Science for Public Good*" Bootcamp by Kodluyoruz
- learning machine learning models, SQL, and Power BI

I neglected my github and other coding platforms for a while, and I currently working on improving them!
